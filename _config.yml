  Hi, my name is Sulabh Katiyar and I am a research student working towards my Ph.D on Image Caption Generation. During my Ph.D I have studied Encoder-Decoder and
  Attention based frameworks and focussed on better utilization of Visual and Semantic Information in Caption Generation process.
  
  My Research Interests lie in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks such as Machine Translation, Image Captioning, Text Summarization, etc.

#  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python programming language</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

          I have studied Image Caption Generation during my Ph.D with a focus on eficient utilization of semantic and visual information 
          for Caption Generation. I have performed comparative analysis of methods proposed in previous works and proposed methods to address
          their limitations. Some of the works towards perusal of my Ph.D are listed below. This includes only published/accepted works.
          - To analyse role of image representation obtained from various pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), I performed comparative
          analysis of different CNN architectures to study their efficacy for Image Caption Generation task. 
          - I have performed comparative analysis of Recurrent Neural Network based Decoder with the recently proposed Convolutional Decoder. 
          I have observed that Convolutional Decoder does not model long term word relationships efficiently.
          - I have proposed Encoder-Decoder and Visual Attention based Caption Generation methods using Contextual Word Embedding Representations for
          enhanced semantic information representation and Perspective Transforms as Data Augmentation mechanism for better exploitation of Visual information.
          In addition, I have used fine tuning of both CNN and Word embedding layers to obtain performance improvements.
          
          The tentative date of my thesis submission is 17th September, 2021.

          I have worked on Extractive Text Summarization during my M.Tech study. I have used lexical relationships among words to formulate improved method for 
          identification of sentences from the text which can be used as summary.

          During my time at NIT Silchar I learnt the basics of Computer Science and Engineering which have served as foundation over which I have continued my studies during M.Tech
          and Ph.D. I also learned skills such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time during B.Tech and learnt a lot which has helped me later in life.
          I spent my free time participating in Quiz Competitions. I also organized a Quiz Competition during annual College Fest. In addition, I served as committee member in 
          organizing teams of annual Alumni Meet and some technical competititions organized by Computer Science and Engineering Department

          I have implemented Encoder-Decoder based Image Captioning method. This method is similar to the Google NIC method proposed in the paper
          [Show and tell: A neural image caption generator](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Vinyals_Show_and_Tell_2015_CVPR_paper.html).
          In this method, an LSTM network is used to generate the next word using word embedding representations of previous words in sentence. Image representation
          generated by a pre-trained CNN is used to initialize hidden and cell states of LSTM.
