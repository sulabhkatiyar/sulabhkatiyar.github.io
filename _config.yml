  Hi, my name is Sulabh Katiyar and I am a research student working towards my Ph.D on Image Caption Generation. During my Ph.D I have studied Encoder-Decoder and
  Attention based frameworks and focussed on better utilization of Visual and Semantic Information in Caption Generation process.
  
  My Research Interests lie in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks such as Machine Translation, Image Captioning, Text Summarization, etc.

#  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python programming language</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

          I have studied Image Caption Generation during my Ph.D with a focus on eficient utilization of semantic and visual information 
          for Caption Generation. I have performed comparative analysis of methods proposed in previous works and proposed methods to address
          their limitations. Some of the works towards perusal of my Ph.D are listed below. This includes only published/accepted works.
          - To analyse role of image representation obtained from various pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), I performed comparative
          analysis of different CNN architectures to study their efficacy for Image Caption Generation task. 
          - I have performed comparative analysis of Recurrent Neural Network based Decoder with the recently proposed Convolutional Decoder. 
          I have observed that Convolutional Decoder does not model long term word relationships efficiently.
          - I have proposed Encoder-Decoder and Visual Attention based Caption Generation methods using Contextual Word Embedding Representations for
          enhanced semantic information representation and Perspective Transforms as Data Augmentation mechanism for better exploitation of Visual information.
          In addition, I have used fine tuning of both CNN and Word embedding layers to obtain performance improvements.
          
          The tentative date of my thesis submission is 17th September, 2021.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
